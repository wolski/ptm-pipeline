ptm-pipeline — Snakemake-based workflow for integrated phosphoproteomics and total proteome analysis.

Scaffolds a complete analysis pipeline into projects with existing DEA (Differential Expression Analysis) output from prolfquapp. Automates three complementary PTM analyses (DPA, DPU, CorrectFirst) using prophosqua, plus kinase activity inference via PTM-SEA and Kinase Library.

Usage:
  ptm-pipeline init    # auto-detect DEA folders, generate config and Snakefile
  make all             # run the full pipeline

Dependencies: prolfqua, prolfquapp, prophosqua, prolfquappPTMReaders, Snakemake.

See METHODS.md for full description of the computational workflow and citations.
